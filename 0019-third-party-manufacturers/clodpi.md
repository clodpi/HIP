* MIPS24KEc (575/580 MHz) with   64 KB I-Cache and 32 KB D-Cache
* Ethernet and 4G Backhaul
* WiFi
* GPS
* POE 802.3at
* IP67
* Lightning surge protection
* Outdoor fiberglass LoRa Antenna

## Customer Support

* Discord Channel and Email
* Round the clock customer enquiry
* SSH Remote access to address Gateway issues
* 1 Year Warrenty for hardware
* Repair/Replacement : Defect due to manufacturing will be replaced at FOC , We do maintain 5% inventory for each batch. This would reduce the turn around time for replacement.
* Warranty Exclusion Tempering, Misuse, Fire, Maintenance by an unauthorized method and Product not used as per user manual recommendations.

## Hardware Security

All the miner variants features a secure element, powered by ATECC608B from Microchip. And the key data to be secured (swarm keys, API tokens, etc) are kept in a separate partition which is encrypted and secured by using the secure element.
In addition to that, the firmware upgrade process is also secured with encryption over the wire and at rest. And the firmware updates applied after verification of the authenticity of the payload.

## Manufacturing Information

We are in this business for the last five years working with number of trusted manufacturing partners across India and Asia Pac. We have successfully delivered multiple major projects including energy metering with more than 60,000 units and many other solutions in India, all completely designed and manufactured inhouse. We will continue leveraging our experience and our networks for manufacturing the Helium range of products.

## Proof of Identity

To be submitted in private.

## Budget & Capital

We are manufacturing up to 3000 units of similar gateways every month for the existing demand. And we are capable (interms of capital and manpower) of expanding it up to 3x based the market needs.

## Risks & Challenges

The main risks and challenges are the supply of the components and assembly of the associated electronics. Fortunately the sources which we are working with is one we have successfully used many times before and we know and trust they can deliver to schedule.
With our established network, we can supply 10000 units within 8 to 12 weeks of lead time. With the demand for our gateways, we have started the manufacturing already.
